Data Structures: a format used to store and organize information.

Stacks: 
List like data structure but you can only remove the last item from a stack. 
Removign the last item from a stack is called popping. 
Putting the last item onto the stack is called pushing 
LIFO data structure (last-in-first-out)

There are standard libraries for building this data structure but we will do it manually 

See example 1 in notes.py

Reversing a String with a Stack 
A stack can reverse an iterable, because whatever you put on a stack comes off in reverse order.
So if we put a string on a stack we can get the reverse order by taking it off the stack

See example 2 in notes.py

Queues: 
A queue is another data structure. A queue is also like a list; you can add and remove items from it, in a specific order. 
Unlike a stack a queue is first-in-first-out or FIFO. The first item added in is always the first item taken out. 

See example 3 in notes.py 

Example 4 is creating a ticket queue
